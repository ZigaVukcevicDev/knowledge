## Git

### Init

Initializes a repository in an existing directory. This will create `.git` hidden folder, a location where Git operates.

```
git init
```

### Status

Shows the working tree status.

```
git status
```

### Add

This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content `staged` for the next commit.

```
git add some-file.txt
```

Wildcards are supported, e.g. `git add '*.txt'` or you can add all files by `git add .`

### Commit

Check how to properly write a git [commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Records changes to the repository. By using `-m` flag, a custom message will be added with commit.

```
git commit -m "Some message"
```

By using `-a` flag, command will also do `git add .`

```
git commit -a -m "Some message"
```

### Log

Shows local commit logs.

```
git log
```

Shows remote commit logs.

```
git log origin/master
```

Shows local commit logs in one line / commit.

```
git log --oneline
```

Shows local commit logs with graphic appearance.

```
git log --graph
```

### Remote add

Manages set of tracked repositories.

```
git remote add origin some-url
```

### Push

Updates remote refs along with associated objects. The flag `-u` tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do.

```
git push -u origin master
```

### Pull

Fetches from and integrate with another repository or a local branch.

```
git pull origin master
```

### Diff

Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

```
git diff
```

Shows difference of most recent commit, which is referred using the HEAD pointer.

```
git diff HEAD
```

Shows staged difference.

```
git diff --staged
```
### Clean

Removes untracked files from the working tree.

```
git clean -f
```

Flag `f` will force deletion, otherwise git will refuse it.

### Reset

Unstages files.

```
git reset some-file.txt
```

Flag `soft` will move HEAD 1 commit back and put changes as they were not commited yet, so you can commit them again.

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Flag `hard` will move HEAD 1 commit back and delete changes.

```
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Revert

It will revert commit by adding a commit (so you can see the history of what has been reverted).

```
git revert commitId
```

### Checkout

Changes file back to how it was at the last commit.

```
git checkout -- some-file.txt
```

### Branches

Creates new branch

```
git branch new_branch_name
```

Deletes branch

```
git branch -d branch_name
```

Checkouts to new branch

```
git checkout new_branch_name
```

Merges branch into checkouted branch (e.g. first checkout to master branch, then merge develop branch into)

```
git merge name_of_branch
```

Shows merged branches that had been merged at any time

```
git branch --merged
```

### Clone

It will clone remote repository to local one.

```
git clone some-url
```

### Tags

Listing tags

```
git tag
```

Creating annotated tag

```
git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
git push origin --tags
```

Deleting tag

```
git tag -d v1.4
```

### Submodules

Go to root folder.

```
git submodule add some-repo-url some-folder
```
